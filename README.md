# C# and .NET Course at The Tech Academy
This repository contains code and projects from my C# and .NET course at The Tech Academy. The course covered a range of topics, including:

<li>C# programming fundamentals
<li>Object-oriented programming principles
<li>.NET Framework and libraries
<li>ASP.NET and MVC web development
<li>Database design and SQL programming
<li>Entity Framework and LINQ
<li>Testing and debugging techniques

# Projects
Here are some of the projects I worked on during the course and their descriptions below:

+ [Package Express](https://github.com/jmduea/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/PackageExpress)
+ [Car Insurance](https://github.com/jmduea/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)


# Package Express:
This is a console application that estimates the cost of shipping a package with Package Express. It prompts the user to enter the package weight, width, height, and length, and calculates the total package dimension. If the package exceeds weight or dimension limits, it prompts the user to ship a different package. If the package meets the requirements, it calculates the shipping cost and prints the result in a dollar amount with two decimal places. The program then asks the user if they want to ship another package, and if they say no, the program ends. This code shows a grasp of basic C# programming concepts such as user input/output, conditional statements, loops, data types, arithmetic operations, and type conversion.

# Car Insurance:
This is an MVC web application that imitates a car insurance website. It takes user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. Additionally, there is an admin page that enables staff to view all of the issued quotes. The code demonstrates proficiency in C# programming concepts, including MVC architecture, data models, view rendering, and database interaction.
